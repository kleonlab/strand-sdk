# Strand SDK Documentation

Welcome to the **Strand SDK** documentation. Strand is a production-ready Python toolkit for optimizing biological sequences with composable reward blocks and interchangeable optimization backends.

## Getting Started

- [Installation](./getting_started.md) — Set up Strand SDK in your environment
- [Quick Start](./tutorial/quick_start.md) — Run your first optimization
- [Core Concepts](./tutorial/core_concepts.md) — Understand Strand's architecture

## Tutorials

- [Quick Start](./tutorial/quick_start.md) — Run your first optimization in 5 minutes
- [Core Concepts](./tutorial/core_concepts.md) — Understand Strand's architecture and design patterns

## API Reference

- [Core API](./api_reference.md) — `Optimizer`, `Sequence`, `Results`
- [Reward Blocks](./reward_blocks.md) — Built-in and custom rewards
- [Optimization Methods](./optimization_methods.md) — CEM, CMA-ES, Genetic Algorithm
- [Manifests](./manifests.md) — Experiment provenance and reproducibility

## Advanced Topics

Coming soon:
- Advanced optimization techniques
- Performance tuning and scaling
